## What's happening again?

Climate change is increasing the threat of water scarcity worldwide. This is terrible for a variety of reasons. To name a few:

- Traditionally arid areas are increasing in aridity, and deserts are rapidly expanding, so people in arid places are in danger to water scarcity.
- People at the edges of oceans and small island communites are in danger as well, because of the abundance of salt water but lack of fresh water.

## How is this caused?

Normally in the winter, rain falls as snow, and snow packs act as natural reservoirs until summer. However, as the climate changes, rain will fall as water in the winter, and will not form snow packs, and so the water is not stored until summer.

## How does this affect us, as a species?

- People in no longer arable areas will need to migrate to habitable land.
- There will be mass migrations for climate refugees.
- A famine will occur, as there will not be enough food for the refugees.

## How could we fix this problem?

Desalination plants can be built for people with excessive amounts of salt water. We can also build more reservoirs to hold rainfall, as snow packs will not be able to reliably hold rainfall as the climate changes.
